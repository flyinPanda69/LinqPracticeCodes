Comparing 2 lists :

Console.WriteLine(lis1 == list2);
Console.WriteLine(Equals(list1, list2));
Console.WriteLine(list1.equals(list2));
Console.WriteLine(list1.SequenceEqual(list2));   //true



//Distinct - Can be used on any collection, returns all the unique item in the collection
// Union - Unique element from both the collections.
//Intersect - Need another collection, unique element present in both the collection
//Except - It gives only values which are different in the collections (present in one(first) and not present in the other.)




//Partioning Methods:
Skip - skips the given element.
Take - takes given amount of element
SkipWhile - Starts checking from the start and then match the condition and then stop skipping. 
TakeWhile - Taking until the condition is matched.


//Quantifiers

All - Checks if all the element in the collection matches the given condition.
Any - Checks if at least one element in the collection that satisfies the condition.
Contains - Given values is contained or not.


//Concatenation
list1.Concat(list2).ToArray()
